# Bonus Session

Internal session at BlockScience resulted in some general descriptions of modeling approaches for cryptoeconomic systems. This worked occured between Sessions 5 and 6, and are logged here for references.

Content:

- given a computational model of a cryptoeconomic systems which is characterized by supply of service on platform, demand for that service. 
- given a cryptoeconomic asset which is trading on a secondary market and which serves as the medium of exchange in the afforementioned serice patform
- supply, demand and secondary market price as are unknown driving signals which are "processed" by the cryptoeconomic mechanisms at play and result in KPIs such as the profit margins for operators, the effective costs incurred by service consumers, etc
- the photos in the folder describe a series of testing schemes of increasing complexity which may be applied to characterize those mechanisms under a range of assumptions
- these testing schemes account for both the categories of decision heuristics for a wide range of personas (of which strict profit maximization is only one, and furthermore the timescale of profit maximization impacts the strategy significantly), as well as wide range of standard signal processessing tests aimed at identifying any latent instability or risks of cascade failure.
