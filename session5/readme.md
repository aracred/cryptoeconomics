# AraCred token economics session 5

with Special guest @decentralion

## discussion

1. overview of aracred as envisioned and mapped by @mzargham and @burrrata to date
2. further discussion of AraCred lineage with attention interesting things happening in MetaGame and the effort to reverse out reusable patterns while minimizing the extent to which those patterns force decisions about economics and governance on the communities using them
3. discussion of modularity and the successes of Aragon to enable modularity, with special attention to 1hive, who among others for both designing modular components and dogfooding them
4. on collapsing "metrics" to humans with spreadsheets
5. i recommend a short clip from Wassim Alsindi's lecture (to law students) which i jokingly refer to as ["making up numbers for lawyers"](https://youtu.be/cpHWegbGgWc?t=401)
6. deeper dive into how sourcecred itself fits into the framework under discussion: main point was that we're focusing on some sections which have sort of collapsed out, and that further attention on minting and redemption of Grain tokens for fiat as well as how the boosting relates to cred calculations would be necessary to support a SourceCred grain instance of aracred but also this still has a long roadmap on the sourcecred side, establishing a sense of timeline will require further research in the sourcecred docs and channels.
7. discussions of how to bring the technical knowledge and governance knowledge into the same venue to accelerate learning. @mzargham, @decentralion and @burrrata participating in seminars with [metagov.org](metagov.org)
