# Cryptoeconomics Session #4

Topics:

1. Lineage of Aracred and the story of the evolution of DAOs as institutions, and its relation to the practice of Token Engineering
2. Review of the 3 Key stages in the processes for creating and allocating Aracred tokens as a result of the DAOs "value system".  Three stages i) KPIs and the ability to adapt them, aka steering spaceship AraCred, ii) Minting functions as a function of those KPIs, and iii) allocation of those tokens for contributors.
3. Deep dive into stage i) of the above see  [Video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q0i3kn5hx2zzopq/cryptoecon-aracred-session-4.mp4?dl=0)
